# 6-Stage-Pipelined-RlSC-Processor
This project implements a custom 6-stage pipelined RISC processor that operates across two asynchronous clock domains. The pipeline stages are organized as: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Register Read (RR), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write-Back (WB). To balance timing and simplify multi-clock behavior, the design alternates stages between two clocks: clk1 drives IF, RR, and MEM, while clk2 drives ID, EX, and WB. This separation provides more flexible timing control, reduces critical-path pressure, and allows the pipeline to sustain operations even when earlier stages are stalled.
The architecture supports ALU operations, load/store instructions, branching, jump-and-link behavior, and flag-based execution. It includes data forwarding, load-use stall detection, and automatic pipeline freezing when hazards occur. A dedicated load-dependency mechanism inserts two-cycle stalls, temporarily disabling IF, ID, and RR without interrupting EX, MEM, and WB stages. The processor maintains its own instruction and data memories, a register file, and condition flags, enabling a complete, self-contained pipelined execution environment suitable for simulation and educational study.
